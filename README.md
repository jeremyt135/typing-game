# "Type Attack" typing game
This is a timed typing game where players have 1 minute to type a number of average-length, or 5 character, words. Score is increased by completing words, and the game is over when 1 minute is up or their life points drop to 0 (failing to finish words reduces life points). 

## Notes
A version of this project is also available at http://type-attack.herokuapp.com/ but going forward the most up-to-date version will be at https://jeremyt135.github.io/typing-game/.
